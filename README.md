## Documentation

### Sample File Upload code
`App\Http\Controllers\UploadController.php` has the code for managing the file upload and receiving. 


### Generate Migration schema and Model from artisan commands

Thanks to [Laracasts/Generators](https://github.com/laracasts/Laravel-5-Generators-Extended) , you can generate migrations, along with schemas using commands like:
```
// Auto declare table names and columns
php artisan make:migration:schema create_users_table --schema="username:string, email:string:unique"

// Easy foreign relationships
php artisan make:migration:schema create_posts_table --schema="user_id:integer:foreign, title:string, body:text"

// Super easy pivot tables
php artisan make:migration:pivot tags posts
```

Generate Models from tables in database. (Courtesy [Laracademy/Generators](https://github.com/laracademy/generators) )
```
php artisan generate:modelfromtable --table=posts
```
**Important Note:** Do not use the above command for "users" etc, as it would override the class to extend "Model" rather than "Authenticatable".
 

### Easily show Flash messages

Show Flash messages across the application using [laracasts/flash](https://github.com/laracasts/flash) , even as modals if you use Bootstrap. 
```
flash()->success('Hey There! Welcome to Basix for Laravel 5.4');

// For Bootstrap Modals
flash()->overlay('Modal Message', 'Modal Title')
```

Include the following in your blade template file
```
@include('flash::message')
```

### Excel Import and Export
Now import (& Export) data from Excel Sheets. Can be used for seeding: 
 ```
 Excel::load(storage_path('import/Countries.xlsx'), function ($reader) {
             $data = $reader->get();
             foreach ($data as $datum) {
 
                 \App\Country::create([
                     'name' => $datum->country,
                     'official_name' => $datum->full_name,
                     'code' => $datum->iso_3166_1,
                     'code_2' => $datum->iso_3166_2,
                     'long' => $datum->longitude,
                     'lat' => $datum->latitude,
                     'zoom_level' => $datum->zoom_level,
                 ]);
             }
         });
 ```

/imgcache/small/charminar.jpg
/imgcache/medium/charminar.jpg
/imgcache/large/charminar.jpg

//Custom Filters
/imgcache/disabled/charminar.jpg

//Download
/imgcache/download/charminar.jpg
```

### Slugging

Thanks to [cviebrock/eloquent-sluggable](https://github.com/cviebrock/eloquent-sluggable) , create SEO friendly urls like
```
http://yourapplication.com/this-is-a-new-post
```

### Multiple Authentication
Now easily add multiple kinds of authentication to your application, by running simple commands like:
```
php artisan multi-auth:install employee -f
```
This would create separate controllers, route file and middleware for you along with adding the routes to web.php
The package already comes with a sample code for a "Admin" login. Such a timesaver by [Hesto](https://github.com/Hesto/multi-auth) . 

### Social Authentication
Working code for Social Authentication (for Facebook) has been added to this package. Add your facebook app details to your `.env` file.
```
FACEBOOK_ID=YOUR_APP_ID
FACEBOOK_SECRET=YOUR_APP_SECRET
FACEBOOK_URL=http://yourapplication.dev/auth/facebook/callback
```

To add additional social authentication: 

1.Update `config/services.php`
```
    'stripe' => [
        'model' => App\User::class,
        'key' => env('STRIPE_KEY'),
        'secret' => env('STRIPE_SECRET'),
    ],
    'facebook' => [
        'client_id' => env('FACEBOOK_ID'),
        'client_secret' => env('FACEBOOK_SECRET'),
        'redirect' => env('FACEBOOK_URL'),
    ],
```
2.Update `app\HTTP\Controllers\Auth\SocialController.php`. You can simply duplicate the functions for specific drivers. 

3.Update `web.php`. 

### Debug bar for Laravel
Laravel Debug bar is included with this package. You can disable when you set your environment (APP_ENV) as anything but 'local' in your `.env` file. Courtesy: [barryvdh/laravel-debugbar](https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-debugbar)

### Support for your IDE
Helper classes are installed, which helps PhpStorm recognize your laravel classes, so you donâ€™t end up with unnecessary error messages from your IDE. Read the documentation for [barryvdh/laravel-ide-helper](https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-ide-helper) for setting up for sublime.
